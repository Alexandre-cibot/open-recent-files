## Definition
### Goals
This module aims to make switching branches easier.
How ? 
- The program open your TextEditor (VsCode by default)
- It make a diff between you current branch and the develop branch.
- If there is some difference, it means that you'r branch has been modified by you, so it open these files for you
Then, you'r ready to code in a second.

### Tech
Module build in NodeJs.

For personnal reasons, I need to use this code on a Nodejs v0.10 machine.
So some of the code is not up to date with current version of ecmascript.
