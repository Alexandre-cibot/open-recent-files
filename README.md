## Definition
### Goals
This module aims to make switching branches easier.
__How ?__ 

- The program open your TextEditor (VsCode by default).
- It makes a diff between your current branch and the develop branch.
- If there is some differences, it means that your branch has been modified by you, so it opens those files for you.
Then, you'r ready to go in a second.

### Tech
Module build in NodeJs.

For personnal reasons, I need to use this code on a Nodejs v0.10 machine.
So some of the code is not up to date with current version of ecmascript.
